purple - This aura color pairs well with passionate music listeners.
         Purple auras tune in to get amped up, entertained, and moving while they navigate the twists and turns of their day.

other ways of calculating the aura would be using other meaningful values like: loudness, speechiness and tempo.
Among the top 100 songs there might be songs with very high values that may unbalance the calculation,
and also the top 1 song should have more impact than the top 100, so maybe using only the top 10 songs should give us data that is more representative.
